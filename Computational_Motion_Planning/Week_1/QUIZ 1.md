**1.** If you use the Grassfire or breadth first search procedure to plan a path through a grid from a node A to a node B, then you use the same procedure to plan a path from node B to node A, will the two paths have the same length? 

**Ans : ** YES

<br><br>

**2.** If you use the Grassfire or breadth first search procedure to plan a path through a grid from a node A to a node B, then you use the same procedure to plan a path from node B to node A, are the two paths guaranteed to be the same except in opposite directions? 

**Ans : ** NO

<br><br>

**3.** If you use the Grassfire algorithm to plan a path through a series of grids with increasing dimension, 2 dimensional, 3 dimensional, 4 dimensional etc. The amount of computational effort required increases ___________ with the dimension of the problem.

**Ans : ** Exponentially

<br><br>
