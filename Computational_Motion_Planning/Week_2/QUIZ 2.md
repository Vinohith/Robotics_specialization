**1.** Configuration Space obstacles allow us to model:

**Ans : ** 

- [ ] Only the shape of the robot
- [ ] Only the shapes of the obstacles in the environment  
- [x] Both the geometry of the robot and the shapes of the obstacles in the environment  

<br><br>

**2.** The effective dimension of the configuration space of the robot is determined by:

**Ans : ** 

- [ ] The dimensionality of the workspace, for example a robot restricted to the plane will have a 2 dimensional configuration space while a robot moving in 3 dimensions will have a 3 dimensional configuration space. 
- [x] The number of joints or degrees of freedom that the robot mechanism has. For example a robots that can translate and rotate in the plan will have a 3 dimensional configuration space reflecting 2 degrees of translational freedom and 1 rotational. A robot with 5 revolute joints will have a 5 dimensional configuration space.

**3.** True or false: the Visibility graph method is complete because it will always find a path through space if one exists and report failure if there is no path.

**Ans : ** True

<br><br>

**4.** True or false, the Trapezoidal Decomposition method is complete because it will always find a path through space if one exists and report failure if there is no path.

**Ans : ** True
